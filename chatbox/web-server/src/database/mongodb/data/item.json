The company is actively integrating climate action into its core business operations to create a sustainable and equitable future. Salesforce aims to accelerate the transition to net zero by focusing on sustainability priorities such as emissions reduction, carbon removal, ecosystem restoration, education, mobilization, and innovation. The plan emphasizes the importance of global collaboration and immediate action to address the urgent climate crisis. Salesforce has already achieved net zero emissions by compensating for residual emissions across its value chain. The company is dedicated to continuous improvement, setting ambitious emission reduction targets and investing in renewable energy and high-quality carbon credits to offset remaining emissions. Salesforce encourages other businesses to join in the journey towards a 1.5째C future by prioritizing emission reductions and aligning with global climate goals."
